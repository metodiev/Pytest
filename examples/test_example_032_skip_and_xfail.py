test_example_032_skip_and_xfail.py

This test module demonstrates usage of pytest's skip and xfail markers.

Tests:
- Skip tests conditionally or unconditionally
- Mark tests expected to fail (xfail)

Usage:
- Run: `pytest -v`

pytest marks:
Skip: Avoid running tests that donâ€™t apply in certain environments or conditions.

Xfail(Expected Fail): Mark tests with known bugs or incomplete features without failing the build.

Makes test results clearer and easier to manage.
