# Pytest
This repository demonstrates the use of Pytest for testing Python applications. It includes sample test cases, fixtures, test organization patterns, and custom configurations to provide a complete testing framework. Ideal for learning, practicing, or using as a template for other projects.

-  Parametrize
-  Skipping tests
-  Marking tests
-  Asserting exceptions

###  Fixtures
-  Simple fixture
-  Fixture with teardown
-  Yield fixtures
-  Scope (module, session)
-  Autouse fixtures

### Test Structure
- `conftest.py`
-  Nested test directories
-  Using `pytest.ini`

###  Advanced Features
-  Custom markers
-  Monkeypatching
-  Mocking with `unittest.mock`
-  Pytest-Django / Pytest-Flask integration
-  Capturing stdout/stderr

###  Plugins
-  `pytest-xdist` (parallel tests)
-  `pytest-cov` (coverage)
-  `pytest-html` (HTML reports)
